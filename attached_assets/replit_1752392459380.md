# Personality Test Application

## Overview

This is a modern, full-featured personality test web application built with React and Express.js. The application implements a 16-personality test similar to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), featuring 54 Likert-scale questions across four psychological dimensions. Users take the quiz and receive detailed results about their personality type, including strengths, weaknesses, and famous people who share their type.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: React hooks with localStorage persistence
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui styling
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Session Management**: In-memory storage (development), designed for PostgreSQL sessions (production)
- **API Pattern**: RESTful API with Express routes

### Database Architecture
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured for Neon Database)
- **Schema**: User management with plans for quiz results storage
- **Migrations**: Drizzle-kit for schema migrations

## Key Components

### Quiz System
- **Questions**: 54 carefully crafted questions across 4 dimensions (Mind, Energy, Nature, Tactics)
- **Scoring**: Likert scale (1-5) with weighted scoring system
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bar and question navigation
- **Persistence**: LocalStorage for quiz progress and results

### Personality Assessment
- **Dimensions**: 
  - Mind (Introversion ↔ Extraversion)
  - Energy (Sensing ↔ Intuition)
  - Nature (Thinking ↔ Feeling)
  - Tactics (Judging ↔ Perceiving)
- **Results**: 16 distinct personality types with detailed descriptions
- **Scoring Algorithm**: Percentage-based scoring with type determination

### User Interface
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with desktop optimizations
- **Component Library**: Comprehensive UI components using Radix UI
- **Theming**: Dark/light mode support with CSS custom properties
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support

## Data Flow

### Quiz Flow
1. User starts quiz from home page
2. Questions presented one at a time with progress tracking
3. Answers stored in localStorage for persistence
4. Final scoring calculation determines personality type
5. Results displayed with detailed breakdown and insights

### Data Storage
- **Client-side**: Quiz progress and results in localStorage
- **Server-side**: User authentication and historical results (planned)
- **Database**: User profiles and quiz history (future implementation)

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **React Ecosystem**: React 18, React Query for state management
- **UI Libraries**: Radix UI primitives, Lucide React icons
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, class-variance-authority for component variants
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Date Handling**: date-fns for date manipulation

### Backend Dependencies
- **Express.js**: Web framework with middleware support
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL driver (@neondatabase/serverless)
- **Session Management**: connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL sessions
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution, esbuild for production builds

### Development Tools
- **Build System**: Vite with React plugin
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support across frontend and backend
- **Linting**: ESLint configuration for code quality
- **Database Tools**: Drizzle-kit for migrations and schema management

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Local Development**: Vite dev server with HMR
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connection via DATABASE_URL
- **Session Storage**: In-memory storage for development
- **Build Process**: Concurrent frontend and backend development

### Production Deployment
- **Frontend**: Static build output served by Express
- **Backend**: Node.js server with Express middleware
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-based session store
- **Build Output**: Optimized bundles with tree-shaking

### Configuration Management
- **Environment Variables**: DATABASE_URL for database connection
- **Build Scripts**: Separate development and production builds
- **Static Assets**: Served from dist/public directory
- **API Routes**: Prefixed with /api for clear separation

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation of concerns, type safety throughout, and a focus on user experience. The modular design allows for easy extension and maintenance while providing a robust foundation for personality assessment functionality.
