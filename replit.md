# Personality Test Application

## Overview

This is a modern, full-featured personality test web application built with React and Express.js. The application implements a 16-personality test similar to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), featuring a comprehensive quiz system, detailed results analysis, and a polished user interface. The app guides users through a series of questions to determine their personality type across four key dimensions: Mind, Energy, Nature, and Tactics.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for consistent theming
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Query Management**: TanStack Query for server state management

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript for full-stack type safety
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (configured for Neon Database)
- **Session Storage**: In-memory storage for development, designed for PostgreSQL sessions in production
- **API Pattern**: RESTful API structure with Express routes

### Database Architecture
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations and migrations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with environment-based configuration
- **Schema**: Currently includes user management, ready for quiz results storage
- **Migrations**: Drizzle-kit handles schema changes and database evolution

## Key Components

### Quiz System
- **Question Bank**: 54 carefully crafted questions across 4 personality dimensions
- **Question Types**: Likert scale (1-5) questions for nuanced responses
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress indicator with question navigation
- **State Persistence**: LocalStorage maintains quiz progress across sessions
- **Navigation**: Forward/backward navigation with answer validation

### Personality Assessment Engine
- **Dimensions**: 
  - Mind (Introversion ↔ Extraversion)
  - Energy (Sensing ↔ Intuition) 
  - Nature (Thinking ↔ Feeling)
  - Tactics (Judging ↔ Perceiving)
- **Scoring Algorithm**: Percentage-based scoring with directional question handling
- **Results**: 16 distinct personality types with comprehensive descriptions
- **Type Profiles**: Each type includes strengths, weaknesses, career paths, and famous examples

### User Interface
- **Design System**: Modern, accessible design with consistent spacing and typography
- **Component Library**: Comprehensive UI components built on Radix primitives
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with touch-friendly interactions
- **Theme System**: CSS custom properties for consistent color schemes
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and progress indicators for enhanced UX

## Data Flow

1. **Quiz Initiation**: User starts quiz from home page, initializes localStorage state
2. **Question Progression**: User answers questions, state persists automatically
3. **Score Calculation**: Upon completion, scoring algorithm processes all answers
4. **Results Storage**: Final personality type and scores saved to localStorage
5. **Results Display**: User redirected to results page with detailed analysis

## External Dependencies

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Local Development**: Vite dev server with hot module replacement
- **Database**: Environment variable-based connection to Neon Database
- **Session Storage**: In-memory storage for rapid development iteration
- **Error Handling**: Runtime error overlay for debugging

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite builds optimized static assets to dist/public
- **Backend**: esbuild bundles server code to dist/index.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling via DATABASE_URL
- **Session Persistence**: Connect-pg-simple for production session storage

### Configuration Management
- **Environment Variables**: DATABASE_URL for database connection
- **Build Scripts**: Separate dev, build, and start commands
- **Database Migrations**: Drizzle-kit push command for schema updates
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript compilation verification

The application follows a clean separation of concerns with the client handling all UI interactions and quiz logic, while the server provides a foundation for future features like user accounts, result storage, and social sharing capabilities.
